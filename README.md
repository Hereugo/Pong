# Pong

About:
A classic game of pong using p5.js/

Code details:
I haven't read the rules on how the ball should bounce. 
What I did is just reflect a velocity vector from a wall/player. Each time a ball hits a player the ball speed increases slightly.

Bugs:
  !) Fix collision
  !!) When the ball has a huge velocity it can skip and won't hit a player.
  !!!) Fix on the rules of bouncing.
  !!!!) Actually a ball can bounce on top of a player(W~E~I~R~D)
  !!!!!) Future bugs may accure
